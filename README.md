## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# - Hi, I'm Abraham 
-  I'm a passionate developer who loves solving real-world problems through technology. I'm especially drawn to building responsive and efficient web applications, with a strong focus on clean design and user experience.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced Java for Backend Development with SpringBoot
- ðŸ”­ My toolbelt spans across HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript, ReactJS, TailwindCSS, Sass,Python,SQL & Java.
- I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University Of Ibadan, The Premier University in Nigeria


I enjoy breaking down complex ideas and translating them into practical, working solutions using tools like **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and now diving into **Java Spring Boot** to round out my backend skills.

Whether itâ€™s optimizing a UI, structuring scalable components, or learning a new framework, Iâ€™m always eager to explore how technology can be used to create meaningful, lasting impact.
